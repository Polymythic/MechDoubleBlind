# MechDoubleBlind

## Summary
Python sketch to permit mutiple users to input movement, and based on line of sight, inform users if other mechs have been detected on sensing or visual range.

## Goal
The game of Battletech has perfect location information because all of the miniatures are on the board.  This deprives it of some of the interesting "fog of war" aspects such as enemy discovery, and approach strategy to key targets.  This intends to offer a double-blind application to permit all users to enter their data and determine if, during their movement, they discover any opponents.  It assumes team mates are in perfect communication, so when the discovery is made, the opposing mech can be placed onto the board.
